# Day 25

Day 25 of my 45-day coding challenge! Below are my submissions for today:
> [!NOTE]
> The “Reorder List” problem from GFG and LeetCode are the same, yet they are mentioned twice in the DSA sheet. Also, the question “Permutations in Array” appears twice, but under different names. One is titled “Permutations in Array” and the other as “Permute Two Arrays Such That the Sum of Every Pair is Greater Than or Equal to K.”
